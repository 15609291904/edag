        'overview':'EDAG is a parent blockchian product that provides a completely different distributed consensus approach from current blockchain solutions. It adopts the "Hashgraph" structure and consensus mechanism different from linear blocks to achieve the goal of distributed consistency, and is not limited by current blockchain technology. EDAG guarantees not only consistency, but also  decentralization,high speed, provability, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, ACID compatibility, cheapness, anti-DoS attack and so on. It can be a more efficient (measured 3000+TPS) and more equitable (no need for competition for blocks) Internet trust layer which achieve the consensus on a large-scale but low-cost basis , and a more scalable security consensus agreement.EDAG is also an technology open platform that focuses on application scenarios. We will give priority to the application in the field of games, and continue to develop more application scenario models, allowing more developers to access the EDAG system and building a better community for more people to participate in and benefit from it.EDAG has the potential to become a truly trusted network for mass adoption and application, which will be an important milestone in the exploration of trusted Internet.',
        'Scalability':'Per processing speed reaches 30,000+TPS.',
        'Scalability_tl':'Fast efficiency',
        'Expansibility':'The strong coupling of transaction recording and confirmation binds the scalability of this system, and the network should be more flexible.',

        'Interoperability_tl':'Interoperability',
        'P2P_Network_tl':'P2P Network',
        'P2P_Network':'Peer-to-Peer network mainly adopts the Kad algorithm, which is a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology. The DHT algorithm uses a distributed hash table on the resource number and node number, which makes the resource space and node space number unique and uniform distributed and can meet the requirements of structured distributed network. DHT can quickly and accurately route and locate data in a distributed environment.Nodes usually use the TCP protocol to establish connections with neighboring nodes. When establishing a connection, there is also a communication process of authenticating "handshake", which is used to determine the protocol version, software version, node IP, block height, and so on.',
        'Node_tl':'Node',
        'Node':'There are two types of nodes in the network, ordinary nodes and witness nodes. The normal node is responsible for maintaining its own account transaction chain according to agreement. The witness node is generated by the election agent, which is responsible for collecting the transaction units of the network and broadcasting the verified transaction set to the witness node network , to maintain the final consistency consensus of the entire network .',
        'Account_DAG_tl':'Account - DAG',
        'Account_DAG':'World State means writing and verifying by the account chain through decoupling transactions, the operation protocol replaced by the design protocol, reaching a final consensus by the witness node asynchronously , and forming the general DAG. Changes in the trading unit on the account chain mean changes in world state, which are transformed by the merkle tree and hash corresponding to the account status.',
        'Account_tl':'Account',
        'Account':'Each common node account maintains its own account transaction chain locally, which is a block based on block lattice and contains the balance of the account and the history of each transaction.',
        'Transaction_tl':'Transaction',
        'Transaction':"Transaction is the abstract expression of ordinary and contract transactions.A complete normal transaction corresponds to a transaction pair consisting of a transaction unit issued by a sender's account chain and a transaction unit received on the receiver's account chain.The sender transaction unit contains the hash value of the previous transaction unit in the account chain, the account address to be sent, the sender account signature, and the unit hash value. The receiver transaction unit includes the hash value of sender's transaction unit , the receiver signature, and the unit hash value. After the sender sends out the transaction, the amount is locked and cannot be revoked. When the receiver successfully creates a receiving transaction unit and broadcasts it, the transaction is confirmed and asset is received.",
        'Witness_tl':'Witness',
        'Witness':"The Witness node is responsible for verifying the transaction and maintaining the final consistency of the general ledger. Since the account chain model of the block lattice designed for high performance is maintained by the account node, the security risk for no verification of the majority of nodes is generated, and the double spend attack problem of the malicious node must be solved. RAIBLOCKS applies a voting mechanism based on the balance weight to solve this problem. This mechanism cannot quantify the cost of a malicious attacker's overturning of a historical book under the confidence threshold that meets the need for transaction confirmation. The speed of convergence and the robust of reaching consensus are also difficult to estimate. This requires a higher level of security. The packaged transaction collection mechanism of the witness node will be synchronized in the network through the design concept of the longest chain. In addition, world state will reach the consensus when sufficient security and confidence are confirmed by the longest chain of stratified consensus mechanisms.",
