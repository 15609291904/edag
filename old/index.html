            <p class="p">EDAG is a backbone product that provides a completely different distributed consensus approach from current blockchain solutions. It takes advantage of the "Hashgraph" structure and consensus mechanism different from linear blocks to achieve the goal of distributed consistency, beyond the limitation of the current blockchain technology. EDAG not only guarantees consistency, but also considers decentralization, speediness, provability, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, ACID compatibility, cheapness, anti-DoS attack and so on. It can achieve the consensus on a large scale but low-cost basis to become a more efficient (processing tens of thousands of transactions per second) and more equitable (no need for competition for blocks) Internet trust layer. EDAG has the potential to become a truly trusted network for mass adoption and application, which will be an important milestone in the exploration of trusted Internet.</p>

                <p class="sys">The core layer includes P2P modules for network communication, ledger memory and
                    consensus mechanism. The upper layer is the computing layer, supporting Turing-complete smart
                    contract. The system is composed of ordinary nodes and witness nodes. The former manages and
                    maintains its own account chain, while the latter collects transactions of the whole account chain,
                    processes branches and maintains the consistency of DAG. The two layers of entire consensus state
                    respectively are the temporary consensus of the account layer of ordinary nodes, and the ultimate
                    consensus of the whole network maintained by witness nodes.

                                network. DHT can quickly and accurately route and locate data. Nodes are usually
                                connected through the TCP protocol and confirmed by a communication process, used to
                                determine the protocol version, software version, node IP, block height and so on.

                            <div class="div6">Transaction is the abstract expression of ordinary and contract
                                transactions. A complete ordinary transaction corresponds to a transaction pair
                                consisting of a delivery unit from the sender account chain and an acceptance unit from
                                the receiver account chain. The sender transaction unit contains the hash value of the
                                previous unit, address of the receiving account, signature of the sender account, and
                                the unit hash value. The receiver transaction unit contains the hash value from the
                                sender transaction unit, signature of the receiver, and the unit hash value. The amount
                                will be locked after issuing the transaction and cannot be revoked. Only when the
                                receiver successfully creates a receiving unit and broadcasts to confirm the transaction

                            <div class="div7">The witness node verifies transaction and maintains ultimate consistency
                                of the integrated ledger. The BlockLattice model is designed for high performance, and
                                is maintained by the nodes of the account chain, thus creating security risks of
                                verification. Among these risks, double-spending attack of malicious nodes should be
                                handled first. Therefore, RAIBLOCKS applies a voting mechanism based on the balance
                                weight to solve it. If the confidence threshold value of transaction confirmation is
                                satisfied, the cost of damaging historical ledgers by malicious attackers through
                                branches will be incalculable, as well as the rate of convergence and the robustness of
                                consensus. This requires a higher level of security. The packaged transaction collection
                                mechanism of the witness node will be synchronized in the network through the design
                                concept of the longest chain. In addition, world state will reach the consensus when
                                sufficient security and confidence are confirmed by the longest chain of stratified
                                consensus mechanisms.<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom"></i>
